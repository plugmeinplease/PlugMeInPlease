No passion; they just waste away their brain with garbage to pass the hours. The satisfaction of dopamine flooding into their miniscule receptors is absolutely pathetic. They enjoy nothing of value. They c0nsume endlessly. They never tire or grow satisfied. In fact, just the inverse is true. As they devour more, their appitite increases exponentially. The ability to maintain focus diminishes, and the cycle is repeated until the next pieceof trash attracts their bug-like attention span. Nothing is ever accomplished, we are c0nsuming ourselves.">
