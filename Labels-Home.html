				<!-- Snake Eyes & sevens write up -->
				<div>
					<p>
						Snake Eyes & Sevens is a label that I don't have much info on aside from being located in Madison, Wisconsin which any idiot could tell within 2 seconds of going to their bandcamp.
						I believe they handle small scale production of cassette tapes, but haven't found any online listings to confirm this aside from the artists mentioning here and there that cassette tapes are available.  Their artwork designs generally take influence from the visual of the hardcore, punk, emo, goth, and metal scenes in the midwestern USA.
						With lofidelity crunchy, overdriven artists such as DJ Speedsick, Crime Unit, and DJ Loser, they offer a fresh DIY take on electronic musics audiophile ethos.<a href="https://1-1-7.bandcamp.com/album/julien-andreas-trust-in-filth-117-07" target="_blank" class="LinksPink"> Julien Anderas' Trust In Filth Release </a> is especially captivating. Ranging from Techno -> Gabber -> Industrial -> Trance, this albums got it all.
						<br>It appears SE&S did one major release dump on November 2018, so we will have to wait to see if it was a one off project or something that will continue to release solid tracks.

				<!-- Bass Agenda write up -->
				<div>
					<p>
						Bass Agenda recordings is a no B.S electro label based out of the UK. Their ethos and quality is unmatched, keeping it strictly about the music and taking inspiration from legends such as Drexciya, Cybotron, Model 500, and Afrika Bambaataa. Bass Agenda does a weekly show each Friday on <a href="http://deepspaceradio.com/" class="LinksPink" target="blank">Deep Space Radio.</a>
						Earliest documented release I can find is 2013 but I wouldn't be surprised to find out they've been around for longer. 
						Releases range from the AI inspired Go Nuclear, dark DXmode, acidic Zeta Reticula, and the classic Detroit's Filthiest.
						<br> Bass Agenda pays homage to the genre and is a label you must have your eyes on going forward. Their releases are fairly priced, and they also offer 4 free Sampler albums to check out  many artists.

				<!-- Blind Allies write up -->
				<div>
					<p>
						Blind Allies is a relatively new label having sprung up with their Muteness LP in 2017. Debuing with electro powerhouses such as DVS NME, Gosub, Lectromagnetique, and Cosmic Force, they imedietely demonstrated to the world they are here to stay. Generally they release compilation albums, fusing the identities of the aritsts and label further. In general, Blind Allies promotes some of the most extreme fusions of psycho-land acid, electro, and futerism I have ever seen. When you pair that with their
						incredible dedication towards the visual element of their releases, this label takes you to a place that isn't of this world. 
						Releases are selling out quick, and the majority of them are Vinyl only so don't sleep.

					<p>
						Tomahawk Records is 5 releases deep since 2016. Ranging from slow warmups into your night of debauchery, all the way to peek hour acidic bangers. From tribal sunrises to underwater churches. Tomahawk swirls and sloshes tracks around, creating a lush soundscape to wade in. having sold out every release so far from Anthony Fade, Reptant, Jurchen, Babylon Barseb√§ck and Intimacy, this trend is expected to continue.

					<p>
						A very fresh label / collective from the French Suburbs of Paris. Aiming to promote the young underground, like HAT-R, ATIM, BXTR, SHERPA, and more, they have definitely been cooking up some events for a few years. I'm very excited to see more from them with this big boomy agressive style they seem to be promoting.

				<div>
					<p>
						An absolute must have in any label list. Going into Stay Up Forever records you know exactly what to expect: You'll get nothing but straight psycho oldschool
					warehouse rave feels with these tracks, but don't let that make you think for a second these are generic cookie-cutter tracks.  Stay up forever records has been banging UK acid since 1992.
					Monsters like Chris Liberator, D.A.V.E the Drummer, Dyanmo City, Geezer, Secret Hero, Sterling Moss,
					A&E Depot, Magnum Force, Star Power, Triphazard, and so so many more, SU4E has a legacy that will
					go down as one of the best labels in the history of Techno. <br>

				<!-- 5th Gear Records write up -->
				<div>
					<p>
						Classic early 90's thunderdome era gabber traxxx. 5th Gear is a Sub Label of Rams Horn Records, and
						has many sub labels below it such as <a href="https://www.discogs.com/label/441298-Gabberbox" target="blank" class="LinksPink"> GabberBox </a> / <a href="https://www.discogs.com/label/874843-Hardcore-Will-Never-Die-2" class="LinksPink" target="blank">Hardcore Will Never Die</a> / <a href="https://www.discogs.com/label/424626-For-Real-Gabbers-Only" target="blank" class="LinksPink">For Real Gabbers Only</a> / <a href="https://www.discogs.com/label/418406-Hardcore-To-The-Bone-2" class="LinksPink" target="blank"> Hardcore To The Bone</a>, and <a href="https://www.discogs.com/label/424011-Hellraider" class="LinksPink" target="blank">Hellraider.</a> All featuring absolutely insane,
						gritty, horrific, 90's style computer animations and the most ridiculous font choices. These Compilations are excellent and can fit well into a gabber or techno 
						focused set depending on how you like to play with tempos. <br>
						Albums feature the likes of DJ Heaven, DJ Primo, Chronotrigger, Cybernator, and Scarface. Many names are written under fake aliases, mistaken on the track labels, or even just straight up stolen names from bigger DJ's so ID with caution. <br>
						For this reason a lot of people actually HATE 5th gear and similar labels. Some even go as far as to say they killed hardcore.

						A buncha fukn' weirdos from the bay area. I've got no clue what to make out of this one but it's definitely interesting. DII has gotten some buzz on channels like Anti and Harakiri Diat for awhile now, and I personally feel its well deserved.
						I'm pretty sure half the bands are just various makeups of the same people <a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/4799701-Matt-Ferrara-3" target="_blank" class="Links"> Matt Ferrara </a> has a roll in numerous bands such as the catchy Landline, noisy Lil' Dowanger, even noiser Scantron, even NOISER Toyota, and whatever the fuck that is Wonderbread. 
						I personally wouldn't be surprised if they were involved in DI Inc. on a more formal level at some stage in the production but a source would be necessary to confirm....
						<br> anyways, Discontinuous Innovation Inc. Has it all. You got psycho garage noise shit like scantron, hardcore gems like Acrylics, And a lil' in between with Erik Nervous (Conical Cranium Emulation was one of my favorite releases of 2017. There's a lot going on with this label and nearly every release is unique.
						<br> One that especially stands out is addi d's <a href="https://discontinuousinnovationinc.bandcamp.com/album/12-dirges" target="_blank" class="Links"> 12 Dirges.</a> A delightlful break from the weirdness that is DI Inc. with a soft and haunting piano album. Complete with lo-fi cruchy samples, this release is n i c e.
