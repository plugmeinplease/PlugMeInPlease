			It has been at least an hour and your body is screaming at you. 
			Your hands are perpetually spasming in an uncontrollable rage. Your fingers are permanent hooks, following the only motion they know at this point. your nerves running down the elbows howl for relief. 
			They simultaneously feel compressed and overly stretched. <br>
		The pain stretches out into your armpits, down the lats and branches into your chest. <br>
		There's not a chance you could make it back down at this point, your only option is forward. <br>
