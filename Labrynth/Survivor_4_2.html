		This place has been around far longer than all of us. There's something alive down here but i've never seen it myself. Perhaps it doesn't even have a phyiscal form.  It shifts and changes like an organic being, but im certain it is purely machine.....
		
		I wouldn't recommend it, but you've come this far already. Please take this and see where it takes you. <br>
