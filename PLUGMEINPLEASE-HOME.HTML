			Our communcation within the digital realm is underestimated for its potential damage to society.
			Its shortcoming and ultimately destructive to communcation and individual identity in its current form. The leading platforms for online interaction are not made with the purpose of improving our lives, but rather profit and power motives. These goals of developers are lacking in consideration and
			overall ethical restraint regarding the individual users. Furthermore A lack of oversight and regulation from hyper specialized content tailoring promotes tribalism, bubbles of unhealthy rhetoric, and overall a space
			for communities that exist only to hate and destroy others.
