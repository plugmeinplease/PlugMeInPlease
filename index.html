			 <p class="Purpose">Our sole purpose is:</p>
			 
				<Div class="Purpose_1">
					<ul>
						<li> experimenting with how we create and c0nsume digital art while attempting to intersect it with real world experiences.

								<li> 20 years later, the words of Steven R. Holtzman's
									<a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Digital_Mosaics.html?id=QINQAAAAMAAJ
									" target="_blank" class="Links">"Digital Moseics"
									</a> 
									remain relevent. He states that we underutilize computers in our attempts to replicate tools and designs demonstrated in the real world. We create computer art with tools like paintbrushes and spray cans as 
									a crutch because it is what we are familiar with. We constantly try to bring reality into the digital, while we should be utilizing the unique properties of a virtual medium. Just as some techniques don't cross over between watercolor and oil painting,
									the seperation of computer mediums from the traditional methods of the physical world can offer new possibilites. <br>

								</li>
								<br>
								<li> To learn how to code and understand computer Syntax. All postings will be written through the HTML Editor and styled in CSS in order to improve my proficiency. As computers become more and more intergrated into our lives,
									communication with computers on the most basic levels is already a necessary skill many of us are behind on understanding.
								</li>
								<br>
								<li> To have another medium for posting music. I hope to make this another interesting way to find tracks you may have never listened to otherwise.  This aspect is both for my own personal record keeping in order to stay organized, while simultaneously sharing discoveries.
