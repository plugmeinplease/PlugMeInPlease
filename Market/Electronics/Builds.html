						<a href="http://weltenschule.de/TableHooters/instruments.html" link="_blank" class="Link"> CYBERYOGI's </a> Blog is the fattest resource I've got. It hasn't been updated in almost a decade, but their dedication to documenting bends is astonishing and I needed to ensure it lives on. Again, I have NO part in the creation of this resource and all credit goes to the creator, just wanted to share it.
						If you're ever wondering about a sepecific keyboard and it's "bendability" this is the spot to check.
