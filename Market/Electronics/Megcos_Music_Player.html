  I thought the case of this thing was insanely cute and knew I had to bend it. Sadly I encountered numerous problems throughout my bend
  and ended up needing to trash the case and rehouse it. My screwdrivers weren't narrow enough for the small slots, and there was this yucky glue all over the place
	 preventing me from reaching necessary components. I also cracked my case because of a lack of the correct drill bits. Overall, it was my fault I ruined such a fun case but there is still
	 some cool bend potential with this thing if you're interested.
  
  Some bends include a glitchy shimmer switch, overdrive, Pitch control gate cutoff, and a LPF. Intrestingly enough it isn't knob per function
  so depending on the switches that are engaged and the relative knob positions each has a unique function.

						It is pretty much universally agreed upon that Reed Ghazala's book Circuit Bending: Build your
						own alien instruments
						is the best piece of literature on the subject ever published.
						Physical copies are pretty effing expensive these days so
						<a href="https://eternobisiesto.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/circuit-bending-build-your-own-alien-instruments-reed-ghazala.pdf" link="_blank" class="Link"> Here's </a>
						a PDF. In it you'll find basics, tools, tips, common bend diograms, walktrhoughs for good starter
						projects like speak and spells and some Casio SA series. Honestly do yourself a favor and read this because
						it is pure gold.

						<a href="http://weltenschule.de/TableHooters/instruments.html" link="_blank" class="Link"> CYBERYOGI's </a> Blog is the fattest resource I've got. It hasn't been updated in almost a decade, but their dedication to documenting bends is astonishing and I needed to ensure it lives on. Again, I have NO part in the creation of this resource and all credit goes to the creator, just wanted to share it.
						If you're ever wondering about a sepecific keyboard and it's "bendability" this is the spot to check.
