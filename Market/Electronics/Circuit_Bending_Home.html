						It is pretty much universally agreed upon that Reed Ghazala's book Circuit Bending: Build your
						own alien instruments
						is the best piece of literature on the subject ever published.
						Physical copies are pretty effing expensive these days so
						<a href="https://eternobisiesto.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/circuit-bending-build-your-own-alien-instruments-reed-ghazala.pdf" link="_blank" class="Link"> Here's </a>
						a PDF. In it you'll find basics, tools, tips, common bend diograms, walktrhoughs for good starter
						projects like speak and spells and some Casio SA series. Honestly do yourself a favor and read this because
						it is pure gold.

						<a href="http://weltenschule.de/TableHooters/instruments.html" link="_blank" class="Link"> CYBERYOGI's </a> Blog is the fattest resource I've got. It hasn't been updated in almost a decade, but their dedication to documenting bends is astonishing and I needed to ensure it lives on. Again, I have NO part in the creation of this resource and all credit goes to the creator, just wanted to share it.
						If you're ever wondering about a sepecific keyboard and it's "bendability" this is the spot to check.

						<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnbfRvqQcfw3eL71HfjROOQ" link="_blank" class="Link"> Simon the Magpie </a> is also a wonderful resource. He is quite silly and does a lot of interesting experiments, most generally end up as wacky noise boxes but that's half the fun right?

						<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCafxR2HWJRmMfSdyZXvZMTw" link="_blank" class="Link"> LOOK MUM NO COMPUTER</a> tends to focus a bit more on modular, but there's definitely some solid electronics resources here. DIY Pedals, circuit bending, and all sorts of wacko shit.

						<a href="https://lushprojects.com/videobend/" link="_blank" class="Link"> Lush Projects </a> has a lot about video circuits and the visual side of circuit bending.
