		<h1>Patch Notes</h1>
	<!-- Intro -->
		<p>
			Here's some wack-o patching methods i've come up with. 
		</p>
		<div>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Summed modulation: 
					<p> By using a sum you can create extremely complex envelopes. In this example, ill start by using a mult on Env 1 and Env 2. This isn't necessary, but I like to get incresingly complex modulation patchways. Env 1 modulates Filter cutoff, while Env 2 modulates the "harmonics" function on the <a href="https://www.noiseengineering.us/shop/basimilus-iteritas-alter"> Basimilis Iteritas Alter. </a>
					I then take my 2nd output of each and feed Env 1 and Env 2 into a sum, then spew that into the "morph" function of the BIA. What you get is related modulation, but extremely strange envelope shaping with positive and negative addition of voltages.

			</li>
			<li>
				Noisy Dithering: 
					<p>
						I haven't found a lot of literature about this but by injecting a noise source -> Attenuator -> the same VCA signal as your audio, you can create a sort of dithering effect. betlow 20% Noise in the signal, you can create quite pleasent sounds, and from the 25% and up your rack will howl with all sorts of digital aliasing and FM crazyness.
