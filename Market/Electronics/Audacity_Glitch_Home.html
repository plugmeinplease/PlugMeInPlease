		<!-- Intro -->
		<div>
			<p>
				This is a method I use quite a bit on here, there's plently of fun stuff to do with it! At its core, Audcity has the ability to completely rewrite the raw file data of images. This can be done with all the typical tools
				within the platform such as reverb, echo, various filters, pitch shifting etc.

		<!-- EffectsList -->
		<div class="Effects">
			<UL>
				<h4> Effects </h4>
				<LI> 
					Echo: The most popular effect. This will create mirages and duplicate images depending on what settings you have. 
				</li>
				<LI>
					Reverb: Similar to Echo but It generally ads some rainbow color distortion as well. Feels a bit more dreamy.
				</li>
				<li>
					Pitch Shifter: The best I can tell this generally handles color. It can break your image if you go too hard with it so take it slow.
				</li>
				<li>
					HP / LP Filter: Also focuses on color. Allows colors of a certain value to pass through the edit.
				</li>
				<li>
					Insert > Noise: I really like throwing bits of noise into images for a super fuzzy glitchy look. Bonus points if you hit the noise with effects afterwards.
				</li>
			</UL>

		<!-- Shortcuts List -->
		<div class="Shortcuts">
			<UL>
				<h4> Shortcuts: These really help speed up the process if you're trying to make a full
				glitch photo set or a gif out of a ton of images. Took me way to long to start using them.</h4>
				<LI> 
					Repeat last effect: CTRL R
				</li>
				<LI>
					Export: CTRL SHIFT E
				</li>

				<p>
					<a href="https://www.hellocatfood.com/databending-using-audacity/" target="_blank"> Hellocatfood</a> did an awesome writeup about how to use audacity to completely trash images and videos. I would recommend supplimenting it with videos <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frxy60gpZ2Y" target="_blank"> 1 </a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEZ9QbnH5Ik" target="_blank"> 2 </a>
				from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/PVACraftGlue" target="_blank"> PVA Glue</a> for details on more complicated bends.
